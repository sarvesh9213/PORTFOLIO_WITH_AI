# 💼 Portfolio with AI – Built using ChatGPT & CloudFour

Welcome to my AI-powered portfolio repository!  
This project includes **two distinct versions** of my personal portfolio website — one crafted with the help of **ChatGPT** and the other designed using **CloudFour**, a UI prototyping tool. Both versions are built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and are 100% responsive, stylish, and modern.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. To build a professional, futuristic portfolio to showcase my skills, achievements, and growth in web development.
2. To explore the **power of AI tools** in front-end development — using them not as shortcuts, but as creative and collaborative partners.

## ⚠️ AI Is Powerful — But Use It Responsibly

While building this, I realized that **AI can accelerate creativity and productivity**, but it's not a replacement for learning fundamentals.  
It’s important to:

- Understand the code you're generating
- Always review and test what AI suggests
- Add your own originality and logic
- Stay cautious of over-reliance on automated tools

> Used properly, AI can **enhance learning and execution** — and this project is proof of that.
